# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

## Introduction:
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial sector aimed at identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on various features associated with the transaction. This project focuses on applying classification algorithms to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, leveraging the power of data science and machine learning.

## Business Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop and deploy machine learning models that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. By doing so, the business aims to minimize financial losses due to fraud and enhance trust and security for credit card users. Effective fraud detection algorithms can help financial institutions mitigate risks, protect customer assets, and maintain the integrity of the financial system.
